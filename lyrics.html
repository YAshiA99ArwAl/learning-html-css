            music
            you only miss the light when its burning low
            only know youve been high when you feeling low
            when you let her goo

            music 

            staring at the fhihsef music clouds
            you see it when you close your eyes
            but you only need the light when its burning low
            only miss the sun when it starts to snow 

            and smth smth i dont have time to waste here
